# ICUR-2019

International Conference of Undergraduate Research is a prestigious academic conference which showcases the best undergraduate research from
around the world. My abstract got selected into ICUR which was based on a report written for one of my units.

Abstract:

Concrete has been used by humans for a long time; after water, it is the second-most utilised substance on Earth. 

It is used globally in basic infrastructure like bridges, roads, runways and dams.The main ingredient of concrete is cement. 

Its production grows by 2.5 percent annually, and is expected to increase from 2.55 billion tons in 2006 to 3.7-4.4 billion tons by 2050. 

However, for every ton of cement produced, 1.25 tonnes of CO 2 are released into the atmosphere. Global cement production accounts for

more than 1.6 × 10⁹ tonnes of CO 2 discharges from all human activities. In contrast, hempcrete is a bio-composite made of the inward 

woody part of the hemp plant mixed with a lime-based binder. It is a carbon negative material — the hemp crop takes in CO 2 while it grows

which, in turn, is stored into the hempcrete block throughout its lifetime. The purpose of theis research paper is to compare the 

properties of hempcrete with concrete and to see if the former performs better than the latter in several categories; these categories 

include  1) sustainabilisustainability, 2)  structural strength 3) commercial viability commercial scale. To do my research I have 

completed a meta-analysis of various research papers and journals. I argue that that hempcrete cannot be used alone as a structural 

material; for it to be commercially viable it would need to be used in conjunction with a load-bearing structure like concrete. However, 

it is expected to cost more than concrete as its cultivation is illegal in many places.
